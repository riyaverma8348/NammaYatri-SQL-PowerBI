# Namma Yatri - Trips Analysis Dashboard | SQL + Power BI + Excel

This project presents a data analysis solution built for trip-level metrics using real-world structured data in Excel and SQL, visualized using an interactive Power BI dashboard.

It simulates a business scenario for Namma Yatri (a mobility platform), where key KPIs such as completed trips, driver earnings, conversion rate, and city-wise searches are tracked for better operational decision-making.

## 🔍 Project Overview

- 📁 **Data Source**: Excel files (multiple sheets for trips, payment, duration, etc.)
- 🧠 **Backend Processing**: SQL queries to filter, transform, and prepare data (joins, aggregations, CTEs)
- 📊 **Visualization Tool**: Microsoft Power BI
- 🧮 **Business Logic**: Conversion rate, fare vs duration, trip count by location

## 💡 Key Insights Delivered

- 🔸 **Driver earnings** totaled **₹751K+** with **983 completed trips**
- 🔸 **Conversion rate** stands at **45.49%** (Quotes vs Searches)
- 🔸 **Top performing areas** by trip count include Nelamangala and Shanti Nagar
- 🔸 **Clear trends** visible in duration, fare, and distance relationships
- 🔸 Geospatial data visualized to show trip concentration across locations
